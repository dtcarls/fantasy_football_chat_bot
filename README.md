## Setting up GroupMe, Discord, or Slack, and deploying app in Heroku

**Do not deploy 2 of the same bot in the same chat. In general, you should let your commissioner do the setup**

### GroupMe Setup
<details>
  <summary>Click to expand!</summary>

Go to www.groupme.com and sign up or login

If you don't have one for your league already, create a new "Group Chat"

![](https://i.imgur.com/32ioDoZ.png)

Next we will setup the bot for GroupMe

Go to https://dev.groupme.com/session/new and login

Click "Create Bot"

![](https://i.imgur.com/TI1bpwE.png)

Create your bot. GroupMe does a good job explaining what each thing is.

![](https://i.imgur.com/DQUcuuI.png)

After you have created your bot you will see something similar to this. Click "Edit"

![](https://i.imgur.com/Z9vwKKt.png)

This page is important as you will need the "Bot ID" on this page.You can also send a test message with the text box to be sure it is connected to your chat room.
Side note: If you use the bot id depicted in the page you will spam an empty chat room so not worth the effort

</details>

### Slack setup
<details>
  <summary>Click to expand!</summary>

Go to https://slack.com/signin and sign in to the workspace the bot will be in

If you don't have one for your league already, create a new League Channel

Next we will setup the bot for Slack

Go to https://api.slack.com/apps/new

Name the app, and choose the intended workspace from the dropdown.

Select the Incoming Webhooks section on the side.

Change the toggle from Off to On.

Select Add New Webhook to Workspace

This page is important as you will need the "Webhook URL" on this page.

### Heroku setup
**"November 28, 2022, Heroku stopped offering free product plans"**

I offer a hosting service far lower than the new costs of Heroku at https://www.GameDayBot.com/

Heroku is what you can use to host the chat bot.

Go to https://id.heroku.com/login and sign up or login

:rotating_light:**Click this purple button to automatically deploy the code:**:rotating_light:

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

:warning::warning::warning::warning::warning::warning::warning::warning::warning::warning::warning::warning::warning::warning::warning::warning::warning::warning::warning::warning::warning::warning::warning::warning::warning::warning::warning::warning::warning:

Go to your dashboard (https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps)
Now you will need to setup your environment variables so that it works for your league. Click Settings at your dashboard. Then click "Reveal Config Vars" button and you will see something like this.

![](https://i.imgur.com/7a1V6v8.png)

Now we will need to edit these variables (click the pencil to the right of the variable to modify)
Note: App will restart when you change any variable so your chat room may be semi-spammed with the init message of "Hi" you can change the INIT_MSG variable to be blank to have no init message. It should also be noted that Heroku seems to restart the app about once a day

See [Environment Variables Section](#environment-variables) for documentation

After you have setup your variables you will need to turn it on. Navigate to the "Resources" tab of your Heroku app Dashboard.
You should see something like below. Click the pencil on the right and toggle the buton so it is blue like depicted and click "Confirm."
![](https://i.imgur.com/J6bpV2I.png)

You're done! You now have a fully featured GroupMe/Slack/Discord chat bot for ESPN leagues! If you have an INIT_MSG you will see it exclaimed in your GroupMe, Discord, or Slack chat room.

Unfortunately to do auto deploys of the latest version you need admin access to the repository on git. You can check for updates on the github page (https://github.com/dtcarls/fantasy_football_chat_bot/commits/master) and click the deploy button again; however, this will deploy a new instance and the variables will need to be edited again.

## FAQ

**League must be full.**

The bot isn't working

* Did you miss a step in the instructions? Try doing it from scratch again. If still no luck, open an issue (https://github.com/dtcarls/fantasy_football_chat_bot/issues) or hop into the discord (link at the top of readme) so the answer can be shared with others.

How are power ranks calculated?

* They are calculated using 2 step dominance, as well as a combination of points scored and margin of victory. Weighted 80/15/5 respectively. I wouldn't so much pay attention to the actual number but more of the gap between teams. Full source of the calculations can be seen here: https://github.com/cwendt94/espn-api/pull/12/files. If you want a tutorial on dominance matrices: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=784TmwaHPOw

Is there a version of this for Yahoo/CBS/NFL/[insert other site]?

* No, this would require a significant rework for other sites.

How do I set another timezone?

* Specify your variable https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones#List

Is there a version of this for Messenger/WhatsApp/[insert other chat]?

* No, but I am open to pull requests implementing their API for additional cross platform support.

My Standings look wrong. I have weird (+1) in it.

* TOP_HALF_SCORING: If set to True, when standings are posted on Wednesday it will also include top half scoring wins
* Top half wins is being in the top half of your league for points and you receive an additional "win" for it. The number in parenthesis (+1) tells you how many added wins over the season for top half wins.
